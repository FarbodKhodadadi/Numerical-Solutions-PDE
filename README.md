# Engineering Mathematics - CA2

## Introduction
This project focuses on simulating **static magnetic fields** using the **PDE toolbox in MATLAB** and solving **partial differential equations (PDEs)** numerically. The assignment involves working with **magnetic fields**, **heat transfer**, and **finite difference methods (FDM)**.

## Features
- **Magnetic Field Simulation**
  - Uses PDE toolbox in MATLAB to analyze static magnetic fields.
  - Models the effect of a **current-carrying coil** with an iron core.
  - Computes **magnetic vector potential (A⃗z)** and **magnetic flux density (B⃗).**

- **PDE Numerical Solution**
  - Solves **heat transfer equations** using numerical methods.
  - Implements **FDM (Finite Difference Method)** for steady-state and transient heat equations.
  - Utilizes **MATLAB’s pdepe function** for solving differential equations.
